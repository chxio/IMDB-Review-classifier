# IMDB-Review-classifier

Hi , i made a IMDB movie Review classifier to decide whether to watch a movie or not based on IMDB reviews.

I used Selenium Web Crawler in this file so make sure have the chromedriver downloaded in your system and the path to chromedriver into line No. 19.

Web Scraping was done by requests and BeautifulSoup (bs4) libraries.

I used 2 classifiers in this file

1. vaderSentiment (link = https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/)
2. TextBlob (link = https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)

Hit me up if you have any issues.

Have a nice day
